        <h3>Odunpazarı</h3>
        <p>Eskişehir's protected heritage district is a real aesthetic treat. Elegant pastel-shaded traditional homes with distinctive overhanging stories and wood-framed shutters stand on narrow stone lanes, along with mosques and other historic structures. Many of the houses contain museums and cafes, while craftwork and vintage stalls dot the lanes. This was Eskişehir's first Turkish district, and it features Ottoman and even Seljuk structures. Odun means 'firewood' (the area was once a firewood bazaar).
        </p>
        <p>To get to Odunpazarı from central Eskişehir, catch the ESTram to the Atatürk Lisesi stop, or it's around a 2.5km walk southeast of the Porsuk River

        <h3> Kurşunlu Külliyesi</h3>
        <p>This sublime old-town complex was built between 1517 and 1525 by a leading master of classical Ottoman architecture, Acem Ali, though internal structures were built and rebuilt in following centuries.
        </p>
        <p>Behind the 1492 Kurşunlu Mosque with its kurşunlu (leaden) dome, the medrese houses the Museum of Meerschaum, which pays homage to the region's 'white gold', or meerschaum (luletaşı in Turkish), a light, porous white stone, in its artistically crafted form. There are some particularly elaborate pipes on display and a handicrafts bazaar.
        </p>
        <p>Next to the medrese, the four-domed tabhane (guesthouse) may also have been a harem. The vaulted imaret (almshouse) and adjacent domed aşevi (kitchen), which respectively house glass-blowing and jewellery studios, were the culinary quarters. The dining hall, kitchen and alcoved oven partly remain. The Ottoman caravansarai, built after 1529, is a cultural centre used for weddings.

        <h3>Museum of the Republican History</h3>

        <p>This museum celebrates Atatürk and the Turkish Republic through hundreds of photos, paintings and collages covering seminal events such as the battles of Gallipoli, Sakarya and Dumlupınar. Models of Turkish WWI warships are displayed, as are more than 50 portraits of Atatürk, and visitors can watch an Atatürk documentary. The imposing building itself (built in 1915) reflects the mores of contemporaneous Western European structures and remains a striking example of Turkey's First National Period of architecture.

        <h3>Ballıhisar(Pessinus)</h3>
        <p>Ballıhisar (Pessinus) is located on the Eskişehir road 117 kms from Ankara. In this historical Phrygian city, you can see the Temple of Cybele, and an open-air museum with ancient sculptures from the 10th century BC. Midas is located at 66 km south of Eskisehir and was one of the most important settlement centers of the Phrygians. There are historical temples and tombs carved into the rock.</p>
